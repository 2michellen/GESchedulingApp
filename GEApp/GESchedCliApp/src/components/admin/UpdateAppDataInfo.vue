        <h5>Notice</h5>
        Due to time constraint, this beta version of the application do not have a direct user interface to add and maintain the following data:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Local hotel information</li>
          <li>Local caterer information</li>
          <li>Notes for the Do First instructions, Attention notes & WiFi access instructions</li>
          <li>Application reference data such as email templates, the applicationâ€™s http port, configurable UI text, view titles and miscellaneous settings.</li>
        </ul>
        The above information are kept in a number of configuration data files. These data files are used to import data into the appliction's database by running batch scripts. Updates can be made to these data files and they can be re-imported. There are some settings each as the application http port and email templates that can be easily overriden without doing the re-import process.
